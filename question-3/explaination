Function Definitions:

//async function addAsync(a, b) {
We define an async function named addAsync that takes two parameters a and b.

   // await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
Inside the function, we create a Promise using new Promise.
We use setTimeout to simulate a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
The resolve function is passed to setTimeout to resolve the Promise after the delay.
The await keyword pauses the execution of the function until the Promise settles (i.e., until the delay is complete).

 //  return a + b;
}
After the delay, the function returns the sum of the two parameters a and b.
Function Definition:

//async function calculate() {
We define another async function named calculate.

   // console.log("Calculating...");
Inside the function, we log the message "Calculating..." to the console.

    //const result = await addAsync(3, 4);
We use the await keyword to call the addAsync function with arguments 3 and 4.
This line waits for the addAsync function to finish its execution and return a result before proceeding.
The result of addAsync(3, 4) (which is 7) is assigned to the variable result.

    //console.log("Result:", result);
}
We log the message "Result:" followed by the value of result to the console.

Calling calculate():
//calculate();
We call the calculate function to start the execution of the code inside it.
This line-by-line explanation breaks down each part of the code, helping to understand how async and await are used to control the asynchronous execution flow.
